=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent::Determined - a virtual browser that retries errors with AnyEvent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent::Determined;
  my $browser = LWP::UserAgent::Determined->new;
  my $response = $browser->get($url, headers... );
  $browser->get_async($url, headers... )->cb(sub {
    my $response = shift->recv;
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<LWP::UserAgent::Determined> works just like L<LWP::UserAgent> (and is based on it, by
being a subclass of it), except that when you use it to get a web page
but run into a possibly-temporary error (like a DNS lookup timeout),
it'll wait a few seconds and retry a few times.

It also adds some methods for controlling exactly what errors are
considered retry-worthy and how many times to wait and for how many
seconds, but normally you needn't bother about these, as the default
settings are relatively sane.

This class not only works like L<LWP::UserAgent::Determined> but also L<AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent>
 (and is based on them, by being a subclass of them),

=head1 METHODS

This module inherits all of L<LWP::UserAgent::Determined>'s methods and 
L<AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent>'s methods.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

This class works by overriding L<AnyEvent::HTTP::LWP::UserAgent>'s C<simple_request> method
with its own around-method that just loops.  See the source of this
module; it's straightforward with caution of asynchronous nature.
